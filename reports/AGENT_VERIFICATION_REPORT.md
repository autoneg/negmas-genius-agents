# Agent Verification Report

This document tracks the systematic verification of all Python agent implementations against their original Java Genius counterparts.

## Verification Methodology

Each agent is verified using two approaches:
1. **Code Analysis**: Compare Python implementation with Java source code from Genius
2. **Behavioral Testing**: Compare negotiation behavior between Python and Java implementations

## Status Legend
- ⬜ NOT STARTED - Agent not yet analyzed
- 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Analysis currently underway
- ✅ VERIFIED - Implementation matches Java behavior
- ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES - Small differences found (documented)
- ❌ MAJOR ISSUES - Significant differences requiring fixes
- 🔧 FIXED - Issues were found and corrected

---

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Agents**: 142 (124 original + 18 newly-added missing ANAC agents)
- **Verified**: 114 (of the original 124)
- **Minor Issues**: 10
- **Major Issues**: 0
- **Not Started**: 0

All 142 agents across ANAC 2010-2019 and the time-dependent base classes are implemented,
importable, registered, and complete a negotiation without error
(`tests/test_python_vs_java.py::test_python_agent_runs`, always-on). The 18 agents added in
the 2026-07-18 completion pass were additionally checked against the real Java agent through
the Genius bridge — see **Genius Completion Update** below.

## Time-Dependent Base Agents (5 agents) - COMPLETED

| Agent | Code Analysis | Behavioral Test | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| TimeDependentAgent | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ VERIFIED | Base class. f(t) = k + (1-k)*t^(1/e), p(t) = Pmin + (Pmax-Pmin)*(1-f(t)) |
| TimeDependentAgentBoulware | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ VERIFIED | e=0.2 (slow concession, tough negotiator) |
| TimeDependentAgentConceder | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ VERIFIED | e=2.0 (fast concession, cooperative) |
| TimeDependentAgentLinear | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ VERIFIED | e=1.0 (constant concession rate) |
| TimeDependentAgentHardliner | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ VERIFIED | e=0.0 (never concedes) |

### Time-Dependent Formula Reference
```
f(t) = k + (1 - k) * t^(1/e)    # Concession function
p(t) = Pmin + (Pmax - Pmin) * (1 - f(t))    # Target utility

Where:
- t: normalized time [0, 1]
- e: concession exponent (e < 1: Boulware, e = 1: Linear, e > 1: Conceder)
- k: initial constant (typically 0)
- Pmin: minimum acceptable utility (reservation value)
- Pmax: maximum utility
```

## Common Patterns Across All Agents

### Concession Strategies
1. **Boulware (e < 1)**: Slow concession, holds firm early, concedes near deadline
2. **Linear (e = 1)**: Constant concession rate
3. **Conceder (e > 1)**: Fast early concession, cooperative
4. **Hardliner (e = 0)**: Never concedes

### Opponent Modeling
1. **Frequency-based**: Track value selection frequency per issue
2. **Statistical**: Mean, variance, deviation of opponent offers
3. **Bayesian**: Prior/posterior probability of opponent type

### Acceptance Strategies
1. **AC_Next**: Accept if offer >= our next bid utility
2. **AC_Const**: Accept if offer >= constant threshold
3. **AC_Combi**: Combined criteria (multiple conditions)
4. **Time-pressure**: Lower threshold near deadline

### Bid Selection
1. **Nash product**: Maximize `our_utility * opponent_utility`
2. **Roulette wheel**: Weighted random selection from candidates
3. **Best-first**: Select bid closest to target utility
4. **Pareto-optimal**: Select from estimated Pareto frontier

## Genius Completion Update (2026-07-18) — 18 newly-added missing agents

These agents were missing from the package (absent vs `GENIUS_INFO`) and were ported in the
completion pass. Each was checked against the real Java agent via
`negmas.genius.GeniusNegotiator` on a shared domain vs a fixed opponent. Ports are
AI-assisted approximations; ✅ = behaves in the same ballpark as Java, ⚠️ = documented
divergence, 🧩 = the real Java agent crashes in the bridge under full information (verified,
not our bug) so only the Python side is observable.

| Year | Agent | Java class | Bridge comparison |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2011 | NiceTitForTat | `Nice_Tit_for_Tat.NiceTitForTat` | ✅ agreement, directionally consistent (Bayesian OM + Nash approximated) |
| 2011 | ValueModelAgent | `ValueModelAgent.ValueModelAgent` | ⚠️ agrees; softer than Java on tiny domains (rate-limited concession approx) |
| 2012 | BRAMAgent2 | `BRAMAgent2.BRAMAgent2` | ✅ matches Java outcome exactly on test domain |
| 2014 | Flinch | `Flinch.Flinch` | ✅ identical agreement + utilities |
| 2014 | SimpaticoAgent | `SimpaticoAgent.Simpatico` | ✅ identical agreement + utilities |
| 2014 | Sobut | `Sobut.Sobut` | ✅ same ballpark (trivial fixed-threshold strategy) |
| 2016 | ParsAgent2 | `pars2.ParsAgent2` | ✅ matches closely (0.85/0.85) |
| 2016 | SYAgent | `syagent.SYAgent` | ✅ matches closely (same utility + offer count) |
| 2017 | TucAgent | `tucagent.TucAgent` | ⚠️ gross "holds firm, settles late" matches; Java never concedes off max on test domain |
| 2018 | BetaOne | `beta_one.Group2` | ✅ Java ran (no crash); qualitatively consistent (anti-Kalai point approximated) |
| 2018 | GroupY | `groupy.GroupY` | ✅ matches (opening-phase max-bid dominance) |
| 2018 | Lancelot | `lancelot.Lancelot` | ✅ identical agreement + close utility trajectory |
| 2018 | Libra | `libra.Libra` | 🧩 Java `Libra` crashes in bridge (bug in its bundled Mamenchis sub-agent); Python runs cleanly |
| 2018 | SMACAgent | `smac_agent.SMAC_Agent` | ✅ same agreement + concession shape |
| 2019 | PodAgent | `podagent.Group1_BOA` | ✅ identical agreement + utilities |
| 2019 | SACRA | `sacra.SACRA` | ✅ same final utilities |
| 2019 | SolverAgent | `solveragent.SolverAgent` | 🧩 Java crashes (NPE without preference uncertainty); Python port runs stably from derived behavior |
| 2019 | TheNewDeal | `thenewdeal.TheNewDeal` | 🧩 Java crashes (NPE, same cause); Python port runs stably from derived behavior |

**How to reproduce:** `pytest tests/test_python_vs_java.py --run-java` runs the strict
Python-vs-Java comparison for every agent (requires a running Genius bridge); it is opt-in
because the approximate ports are not expected to match Java bit-for-bit. The always-on
`test_python_agent_runs` confirms all 142 agents complete a negotiation without error.

**`BetaOne` attribution corrected:** `BetaOne` is the canonical `GENIUS_INFO` name for the
2018 agent (`agents.anac.y2018.beta_one.Group2`), implemented at `y2018/beta_one.py`. The
pre-existing `y2017/beta_one.py` (falsely labelled "ANAC 2017 3rd place"; no such Java agent
exists) was removed as a fabrication.
